## Pre-Game Reactions

Personas reviewed the Iron Throne of Ashes pitch deck before any playtesting. These are first-impression responses — the storefront moment.

-----

**Marcus, 34 — The Competitive Strategist** | Score: 8/10

> “Dark fantasy is crowded but the Doom Toll as a timer adds what Talisman always lacked — genuine urgency. Blood Pact traitor variant is the smart add. I want asymmetric faction powers on day one, not as an expansion.”

*Key concern:* Faction asymmetry is an expectation for this segment. Must be on the explicit v1.1 roadmap.

-----

**Priya, 29 — The Social Gamer** | Score: 7/10

> “Dark fantasy with an impending doom clock — that’s Pandemic in a dungeon and I’m into it. The herald protection rule is clever and I could explain it to my group in thirty seconds. The traitor variant is going to cause table drama in the best way.”

*Key signal:* Herald rule passed the “30-second explanation” test. Blood Pact is a strong word-of-mouth driver for this segment.

-----

**Devon, 41 — The Dad-Gamer** | Score: 5/10

> “Fantasy is familiar but the Doom Toll reaching thirteen sounds intimidating. How do I know if I’m doing well? The victory condition feels a bit unclear on first read. Would need the tutorial to be exceptionally clear.”

*Key concern:* Victory condition legibility. Devon needs to know whether he’s winning at a glance. UI must include a persistent scoring layer.

-----

**Zoe, 26 — The Digital Gamer / Streamer** | Score: 7/10

> “The Blood Pact traitor variant is going to cause chaos and I’m here for it. Dark fantasy is a bit saturated aesthetically but the Doom Toll mechanic is the most narratively compelling timer I’ve seen in this genre.”

*Key signal:* The Blood Pact reveal moment and Doom Toll advance animations are the streaming acquisition hooks. Build them for the clip.

-----

**Raj, 38 — The Tabletop Historian** | Score: 9/10

> “Dark fantasy with a ticking doom clock is where this mechanic suite truly belongs. The Dune parallel is strongest here — four factions, a planet-scale threat, alliance politics. The Herald/Knight/Artificer class structure maps cleanly. This is the design’s natural home.”

*Key signal:* Strongest pre-pitch score in the entire study across all 8 personas and 5 variants. Raj represents the BGG reviewer and long-form content creator segment — the community trust-builders.

-----

**Aaliyah, 31 — The Narrative Gamer / TTRPG Player** | Score: 8/10

> “Four Elemental Courts with distinct aesthetics is the richest lore setup. The Heartstone as a MacGuffin that broke an ancient peace is a classic setup for a reason — players immediately understand why they’re competing. The Herald walking alone through enemy territory tells a story.”

*Key signal:* The Herald’s mechanics are generating narrative imagery before a single game is played. Lore and mechanics are correctly aligned.

-----

**Sam, 23 — The Mobile Gamer / Newcomer** | Score: 5/10

> “Dark fantasy is less familiar to me. The Doom Toll reaching thirteen sounds scary in a good way. I like that nobody gets eliminated — that was always the part of board games that made people quit.”

*Key signal:* “Nobody gets eliminated” is the most important accessibility statement for this segment. It belongs on the storefront page, trailer, and tutorial opening screen.

-----

**Elena, 47 — The Casual-Competitive / Book Club Gamer** | Score: 7/10

> “Dark fantasy with a ticking clock feels a bit heavy for my usual group. But the ‘nobody gets eliminated’ rule is huge. We’ve had nights ruined by one person getting knocked out in round two and spending four hours watching.”

*Key signal:* Confirms Sam’s reading from a different demographic. Broken Court state is not just a mechanics decision — it is the primary accessibility signal for the 35–55 segment.

-----

## What Concerned People Before Playing

Four patterns surfaced consistently across pre-game responses:

**1. Victory condition clarity** (Devon, Elena) — “How do I know if I’m winning?” The Doom Toll is clear. The territory win condition is not immediately legible from the pitch. Requires a persistent UI scoring layer.

**2. Genre saturation** (Marcus, Zoe) — Dark fantasy is acknowledged as competitive. Both flagged it, neither rated below 7. The Doom Toll mechanic is sufficient differentiation once shown.

**3. Asymmetric factions** (Marcus) — Present as an expectation in the competitive strategy segment. Symmetric starting positions are correct for v1.0 but the roadmap must make asymmetric faction powers explicit.

**4. Tutorial weight** (Devon, Sam) — The game’s complexity must be absorbed during play, not before it. A single unclear moment in Turn 3 (War Field) permanently loses these two players.

-----

## Post-Playtest Feedback

After reviewing results from 5 simulated games, personas provided updated assessments.

**Post-playtest average score: 8.4 / 10** — highest of all five variants by a margin of 1.6 points.

-----

**Marcus, 34** | Post score: 8/10

> “This played the best out of all five. Two Dark Lord wins in five games is actually close to target (design spec says 15% — 40% is a bit high, but interesting). The 13-round average gave enough space for rescues, comeback arcs, and genuine tension. Still needs tuning on Escalate card frequency.”

*Actionable:* Reduce Escalate cards 2→1 in the Behavior deck.

-----

**Priya, 29** | Post score: 9/10

> “Loved it. The rescue mechanic (2.8 avg/game!) created real table moments — I rescued my rival because I needed his vote and it came up twice in five games. That’s the social glue this type of game needs. Dark Lord winning twice is genuinely scary.”

*Key insight:* “I rescued my rival because I needed his vote” — this is the sentence the game exists to produce. Every design decision supporting that moment is correct.

-----

**Devon, 41** | Post score: 8/10

> “The longest games (13 rounds average) gave me the most to work with. The rescue mechanic made me feel like cooperation mattered. I’d play this with my older kids.”

*Key insight:* Devon’s pre-game score was 5/10. Post-playtest: 8/10. Largest positive swing of any persona on any variant (+3). The game overcomes its accessibility concerns once played. The tutorial has to get Devon through the door.

-----

**Zoe, 26** | Post score: 9/10

> “This is the playtest winner. 13-round games, Dark Lord wins twice, rescue mechanic fires almost three times per game. That’s three streamable moments per session minimum. The territory spread (4.8 avg) means there’s always a clear map story.”

*Key insight:* Zoe is counting streamable moments per session — she gets 3. This is the correct unit of measurement for the streaming-acquisition channel.

-----

**Raj, 38** | Post score: 9/10

> “Best mechanical expression of the Alliance Engine across all five variants. The 13-round sessions capture the Dune-style slow build. 40% Dark Lord win rate is high — I’d reduce Escalate cards to 1 (from 2) and add a relief valve via Herald actions. But the bones are correct.”

*Actionable:* Herald Actions as Doom relief — a Herald that reaches the Dark Fortress as a solo diplomatic action reduces Doom Toll by 1 without triggering combat. Implement.

-----

**Aaliyah, 31** | Post score: 9/10

> “Rescue mechanic (2.8/game) + territory spread (4.8) + two Dark Lord wins = the most narrative-rich playtest result. The maps at end of each game looked different. Different people were ahead at different times. Stories happened.”

*Key insight:* “Stories happened” is the highest praise a narrative player can give. The rescue mechanic and territory spread together are creating the variance that makes each session distinct.

-----

**Sam, 23** | Post score: 7/10

> “Better than I expected. The rescue mechanic is the part that would hook me — ‘someone saved me’ is immediately emotionally interesting. But I’d want the tutorial to be really excellent. Thirteen rounds requires knowing what you’re doing.”

*Key concern:* Sam’s 7/10 (vs 9/10 for Priya and Zoe) reflects that this variant is not the easiest first board game. The tutorial must carry Sam through the War Field without losing him.

-----

**Elena, 47** | Post score: 8/10

> “This is actually the right experience level for someone who wants to step up from Pandemic. Long enough to feel substantive, complex enough to reward attention. The rescue mechanic would be my favorite moment.”

*Key insight:* “Step up from Pandemic” — this is the positioning statement. Use it.

## Score Summary

|Persona    |Pre-Game|Post-Playtest|Delta   |
|-----------|--------|-------------|--------|
|Marcus, 34 |8       |8            |0       |
|Priya, 29  |7       |9            |+2      |
|Devon, 41  |5       |8            |**+3**  |
|Zoe, 26    |7       |9            |+2      |
|Raj, 38    |9       |9            |0       |
|Aaliyah, 31|8       |9            |+1      |
|Sam, 23    |5       |7            |+2      |
|Elena, 47  |7       |8            |+1      |
|**Average**|**7.0** |**8.4**      |**+1.4**|

The +1.4 average delta is the most important number in this table. The game consistently exceeded expectations on contact. The pitch under-sells what the mechanics deliver. Marketing implication: get people playing as early as possible.

## Mechanic-Level Findings

### Rescue Mechanic (2.8 activations/game)

The standout finding of the entire study. No other variant exceeded 1.4 rescues/game. At 2.8, this is a session-defining moment — not an edge case. Five personas independently named it as their most anticipated in-game moment.

**Design implication:** Every UI, audio, and animation budget decision touching the rescue moment should prioritize it. It is the emotional peak of the average session.

### The Doom Toll

The 13-space track landed well across all segments. The metaphor is immediately legible. The 40% Dark Lord win rate is the only balance concern — a tuning issue, not a structural one. Reduce Escalate cards 2→1.

**Design implication:** The Doom Toll visual must be impossible to ignore at positions 8+. Candle-dimming, ambient sound shifts, Shadowking silhouette growth — these are the pressure system, not decoration.

### Blood Pact (Traitor Variant)

Three personas called it out as a purchase driver before playing. The digital delivery mechanism (Blood Pact card dealt privately through the app) removes the only friction point traitor games typically have — the physical shuffle tell.

**Design implication:** Blood Pact ships at launch. It is an acquisition mechanic disguised as a game mode.

### Herald Diplomatic Protection

Passed the 30-second explanation test (Priya). Generated narrative imagery before any game was played (Aaliyah). The Blight Wraith exception adds appropriate danger without complicating the base rule.

-----

## Three Things That Must Ship at Launch

1. **Blood Pact variant.** Three personas named it as a purchase driver before playing.
1. **Persistent win-condition UI.** Devon and Elena need to know if they’re winning at a glance. This prevents silent churn.
1. **Rescue moment production value.** Audio, animation, and UI beat at the rescue confirmation. It is what people remember.

## One Thing That Must Not Ship at Launch

**Asymmetric faction powers.** Marcus wants them. They belong on the roadmap with a version number attached — not in v1.0. Symmetric starting positions simplify the tutorial, balance testing, and onboarding for Devon and Sam.
